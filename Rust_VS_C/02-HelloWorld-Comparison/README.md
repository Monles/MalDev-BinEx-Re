# Intro
I will use `Kali Linux` to compile C code with `Clang` & `LLVM`. <br>

### What's Clang?
`Clang` is the front-end that compiles C source code to `LLVM Intermediate Representation` **(IR)**, and LLVM handles the rest, including optimization and code generation.

# 1. Installation of LLVM & Clang
### Linux
In Linux, use this command to install `Clang` & `LLVM`. <br>
```bash
sudo apt-get install clang llvm
```

### Windows
You can find the instructions to get started with the LLVM system.
